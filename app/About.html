<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	Hello, this is the about section which I have yet to write. It's a
	work in progress, folks.
</p>
<p>
	This application was made with R's
	<code>shiny</code> and <code>networkD3</code>
	packages and the
	<code>D3.js</code>
	JavaScript library.
</p>
<p>
	A <i>bank holding company</i> is simply a firm that controls one or more banks.
	I've made an attempt here of visualizing the structures of such firms, with an
	eye toward portraying the scale and complexity of organization. (No analysis
	yet.) The underlying data come from the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx">National Information Center</a>
	(NIC) website, where holding company data can be queried via the
	Institution Search form. While the NIC reports data for U.S. companies
	only, many of them control a large number of international subsidiaries
	based in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
	The company structures are not strict hierarchies, in the sense
	that subsidiaries may be partially controlled by multiple parent
	companies (this is not uncommon). The definition of "control"
	(say, of company B by company A) is established in the instructions
	for the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/reportdetail.aspx?sOoYJ+5BzDaGhRRQo6EFJQ==">FR Y-10 Reporting Form</a>
	and includes such criteria as
</p>
<ul class="about">
	<li>Ownership of 25% or more of any class of B's voting securities;</li>
	<li>
		Election of a majority of B's board of directors, trustees,
		general partners, or other high-level management positions;
	</li>
	<li>Ownership of "all or substantially all" of B's assets;</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The forms also provide information on entity types and locations.
	(What does the "location" represent? Place of incorporation?) Some
	holding companies control large numbers of domestic and international
	non-bank subsidiaries.
</p>
<h3>Research Questions</h3>
<ul class="about">
	<li>How can this data be used to characterize the complexity of financial instutitions? (Is there a better measure than simply counting the number of controlled entities?)</li>
	<li>Besides simply being larger, how are the largest BHCs structurally different from medium- and small-sized ones?</li>
	<li>What are the (regulatory) incentives for structuring these institutions a certain way?</li>
	<li>How has the structure of these institutions changed over time? (More complex?)</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
