<h3>About</h3>
<p>
	Hello, this is the about section which I have yet to write. It's a
	work in progress, folks.
</p>
<p>
	This application was made with R's
	<code>shiny</code>
	package and the
	<code>D3.js</code>
	JavaScript library.
</p>
<p>
	The underlying data come from the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx">National Information Center</a>
	(NIC) website, where holding company data can be queried via the
	Institution Search form. The organization hierarchies are returned
	as pdf documents, so some light wrangling is necessary.
</p>
<p>
	The company structures are not strict hierarchies, in the sense
	that subsidiaries may be partially controlled by multiple parent
	companies (this is not uncommon). The definition of "control"
	(say, of company B by company A) is established in the instructions
	for the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/reportdetail.aspx?sOoYJ+5BzDaGhRRQo6EFJQ==">FR Y-10 Reporting Form</a>
	and includes such criteria as
</p>
<ul class="about">
	<li>Ownership of 25% or more of any class of B's voting securities;</li>
	<li>
		Election of a majority of B's board of directors, trustees,
		general partners, or other high-level management positions;
	</li>
	<li>Ownership of "all or substantially all" of B's assets;</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The forms also provide information on entity types and locations.
	(What does the "location" represent? Place of incorporation?) Some
	holding companies control large numbers of domestic and international
	non-bank subsidiaries.
